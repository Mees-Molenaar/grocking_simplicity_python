grocking_simplicity_python
================

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

Initially, this python library is based on [Grokking
Simplicity](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-simplicity) by [Eric
Normand](https://ericnormand.me). In Grokking Simplicity, Eric makes
Javascript functions to implement functional programming principles. In
this library I want to implement these principles in python.

Probably, this package will be a living thing. I will start with some
basic immutability functionalities for dictionaries and lists. This
immutability is important to separate code into Data, Calculations and
Actions, which (I think) is a powerful pattern to use in python
programs.

Furthermore, this package is made using [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai).
This is my first experience with developing in this manner.

Let us see where this journey will take us ðŸ˜Š
